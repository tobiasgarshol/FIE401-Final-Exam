FIE401 Financial Econometrics, final exam of fall semester 2022

# ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether political partisanship affects firms’ decision to pollute. An initial hypothesis is that Republican-governed firms pollute more. Using panel data with time fixed effects we initially find significant correlation between political party and pollution on a facility-chemical level – with chemicals in facilities in Republican-governed districts emitting over 20 per cent more emissions than Democrat-governed districts. However, when controlling for both entity- and time fixed effects we find no significant correlation between political party and emissions. The same results are found after adjusting for selection bias and utilizing a difference-in-difference model.
